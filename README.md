# emetic
That's just the project title for what was intended to eventually be a
quake-like fps (although I knew realistically programming my own engine isn't
the way to make a game).

### TODO
* split things into more functions
* Maps/worlds
* Player movement
* command line options
* Move rendering out of main
* Get and handle more material options
* Add config file support
* Get it working on windows
* In game text
* In game menu

* Multiple light sources
* Crosshairs
